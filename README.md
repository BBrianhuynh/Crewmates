This web app: **A crewmate gallery that allows you to create, read, update, and delete crewmates**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **A create form allows users to add new cremates**
- [x] **Users can name the crewmate and set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values**

## Notes

A few challenges I faced was trying to figure out how to create multiple individual routes for each unique link and be able to edit each
crewmate independently from another.
